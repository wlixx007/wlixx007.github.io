						<b>1. High precision solutions of rarefied gas flow with integral equation models 
						</b></br></br>
						In rarefied gas, the mean-free-path of the molecules is comparable to the characteristic length of the flow. Therefore, the similarity ratio of the mean-free-path over the characteristic length, defined as the Knudsen number, covers a wide range from transitional flow to free molecular flow region. Consequently, the Navier-Stokes equation for continuous and near-continuous flows is no longer valid for rarefied gas flows. Instead, the governing equation becomes the Boltzmann transport equation with various kinetic boundary conditions. The methods to solve Boltzmann equation can be categorized as stochastic simulation and deterministic approaches. On one hand, the intrinsic stochastic property makes it impossible for the direct simulation Monte Carlo methods (DSMC) to achieve very high precision; on the other hand, the deterministic methods to compute the collision kernel is extremely costly. We are interested in certain types one-dimensional rarefied gas flows with simple geometry. By making use of the linearized BGK approximation of the rarefied gas flows, the spatial symmetry and applying the moment method to integrate out two latitudes of the particle velocity, we arrive at a one dimensional Fredholm equation of the second kind with a weakly singular kernel for the macro velocity of the flows. We are able to apply spectral collocation methods on multidomain to solve the Fredholm equation with the precision of 11 decimal places.

						<b>2. Modeling molecular gas flows in a nano-scale channel </b></br></br>
						Gas flows in a nano-scale channel is a type of important flows called the molecular gas flows in microelectromechanical systems (MEMs). The molecular gas flow exhibits a typical multiscale feature in that: within the boundary Knudsen layer of the flow, the gas-wall molecular interaction is dominant and drastically impacts the density distribution and the velocity profile; outside the boundary Knudsen layer is the center flow region, where the flow behaves like the rarefied gas flow. In an extremely narrow channel, the center flow region is overwhelmed by the overlapped Knudsen layer. In a nutshell, there is no unified macroscopic or mesoscopic governing equation to describe this multiscale phenomenon. Especially in the Knudsen layer, we have to resort to the first principle and use molecular dynamics simulation (MD) to capture the flow structure. However, MD simulation is always computational costly and suffers from statistical noise. In this research, we would like to establish mathematical models motivated by the radio distribution function for the density profiles and the velocity profiles of the molecular gas flow, by using numerical data of the MD results near the boundary and the rarefied gas flow results away from the boundary. Our mathematical models provide empirical formulas of the density profile and the velocity profile for the molecular gas Couette flow. We also computed the effective viscosity of molecular gas Couette flow, with which we can write a Navier-Stokes like equation to depict the whole flow region. This Navier-Stokes like model equation is validated by using lattice Boltzmann method in comparison to the MD results near the boundary and the rarefied gas flow results away from the boundary.
